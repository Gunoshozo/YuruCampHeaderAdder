# YuruCampHeaderAdder
Image tool for game "Yuru Camp Have a nice day"&amp;"Summertime Render Another Horizon" (Switch)
Those pictures are DDS files without header, just add a header to it is okay.
Rename the target header file into "header" before runing the script.
For _YuruCamp_, header-1080 for bg, eg. header-2700 for eg/EG_069_A0, EG_070_A0, EG_071_A0, EG_072_A0, EG_073_A0, EG_074_A0.
For _Summer Time Rendering_, header-1080 for bg, eg.
Still not know how to deal with bu and sp files, you can get some correct shapes with header-4096/header-4096r, but the color is incorrect.
